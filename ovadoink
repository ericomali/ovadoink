# DESCRIPTION
# ovadoink - swiss army knife for OVA manipulation
#
# There are many, many features missing from ovftool. This is an attempt to
# fill in some of them, but is in no way exhaustive. Features tend to get added
# as the author needs them; suggestions and improvements are more than welcome.
#
# HISTORY
# 0.2 - Added -t for hardware type and only update manifest if -m specified
# 0.1 - Initial version, no options, simply updates signatures in manifest file
#
# PREHISTORIC
# The author created a previous incarnation of this tool called vmxconv for an
# employer, which was not licensed for open distribution though some copies
# have been found publicly floating about. That employer is now defunct and is
# believed to have supported the release of vmxconv, but any users of that tool
# would probably be better served by moving to this one.
#
# TODO
# Option for removing audio hardware
# Option for altering ethernet device types
# Read only mode with option to validate manifests
# Warn on bogus tar content
